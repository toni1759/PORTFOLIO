## **Sentiment Analysis on Student Feedback** - **[GCP NLP API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language)**

Every year, CMCC sends out an anonymous 'Exit Interview' to the graduating class to gather feedback, extract trends among the responses and use the trends to improve the experience each year. This presents an ideal problem for Natural Language Processesing within the domain of Machine Learn to tackle as we have a dataset of open-text and the need to extract insights about it.
